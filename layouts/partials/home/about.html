                    Hello! I'm a software engineer who likes working on messy problems and turning them into simple and reliable code. I started coding at 10 (thanks to a Python 2 book my dad bought me) and never really stopped.

                    <span class="text-primary">02:</span>
                    I spent three years in the IDF building DevOps and internal tooling, then earned my B.Sc. in Computer Science, graduating magna cum laude.
                </p>

                    <span class="text-primary">03:</span>
                    I've worked across a wide range of languages and technologies, learn new systems quickly, and enjoy digging into complex technical problems.
